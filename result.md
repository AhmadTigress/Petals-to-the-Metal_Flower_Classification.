## Key Metrics
- **Training Accuracy (sparse_categorical_accuracy)**: `12.88%`

- **Validation Accuracy**: `23.51%`

- **Training Loss**: `1.8324`

- **Validation Loss**: `2.0649`

-------

## Interpretation
1. **Low Accuracy (Underfitting)**

  - Both training (12.88%) and validation (23.51%) accuracies are very low, indicating the model is not learning effectively.

  - The validation accuracy is slightly higher than training, which is unusual and suggests potential issues like:

    - Data leakage (e.g., validation set contains easier samples).

    - Incorrect preprocessing (e.g., labels mismatched with images).
